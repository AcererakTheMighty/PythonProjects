Here will be a space I will brainstorm for a story pertaining to this game. I will also be listing possible functions the game may have. 

Main influences to note: 
"House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski
"Infinite Jest" by David Foster Wallace

#Story 



IDEAS:
AI trained off of player movements, anticipates their moves and makes it more confusing for them; places notes at random areas. Possible? I don't entirely know yet.
