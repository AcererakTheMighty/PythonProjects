# PythonProjects
A collection of various Python projects done on my own time. 
Even though I know a lot of Python, consider this a tracker for my learning.

Thanks to TechWithTim for his excellent tutorials, which I followed for most of these projects. 

__Big Projects__
FlappyBirdAI: Perhaps my biggest project yet wherein I completely recreate the game "Flappy Bird" and then train an AI to master it. 
Checkers: Where I completely recreate the game of Checkers. Unfortunately, no AI is involved in this one.
CHESS_AI: A project coming soon, I just have to finish the Checkers program first. 

__Small Projects__
*Quiz Game*: This is just a simple program where it asks the player questions regarding computers. 
*Number Guessing Game*: Self explanatory, a basic program game where the player needs to guess a number correctly. 
*RockPaperScissors*: Self explanatory.
*CYOA*: Self explanatory.
*Password Manager*: A program for storing passwords
*PIG*: A program that simulates the dice game "Pig". 
*Math Questions*: A simple program that challenges you with simple math questions. 
*Slot Machine*: Self explanatory.
*Aim Trainer*: Currently a work in progress. Focuses on using the PyGame module to create a game where you have to click the target before it disappears. 
*Password Generator*: A program for generating passwords at random with the help of user input
*Shortest Path*: an algorithm written to find the proper path through a user-made maze. 
*Turtle Racing*: Yet another PyGame-using program wherein the player chooses a turtle and sees whether they will win in a race. 
*NBA Tester*: An algorithm that finds certain pieces of a dataset and brings them to the front of your attention.
